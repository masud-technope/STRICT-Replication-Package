Constructing invalid Partials
Partials can be constructed by invoking a constructor `Partial(DateTimeFieldType[], int[])` or by merging together a set of partials using `with`, each constructed by calling `Partial(DateTimeFieldType, int)`, e.g.: ``` java Partial a = new Partial(new DateTimeFieldType[] { year(), hourOfDay() }, new int[] { 1, 1}); Partial b = new Partial(year(), 1).with(hourOfDay(), 1); assert(a == b); ``` However, the above doesn't work in all cases: ``` java new Partial(new DateTimeFieldType[] { clockhourOfDay(), hourOfDay() }, new int[] { 1, 1}); // throws Types array must not contain duplicate new Partial(clockhourOfDay(), 1).with(hourOfDay(), 1); // #<Partial [clockhourOfDay=1, hourOfDay=1]> ``` I suppose the Partials should not allow to be constructed in either case. Is that right? There's also a related issue (probably stems from the fact that the Partial is invalid): ``` java new Partial(clockhourOfDay(), 1).with(hourOfDay(), 1).isEqual(new Partial(hourOfDay() ,1).with(clockhourOfDay(), 1)) // throws objects must have matching field types ```
