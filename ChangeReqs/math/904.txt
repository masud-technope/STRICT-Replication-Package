FastMath.pow deviates from Math.pow for negative, finite base values with an exponent 2^52 < y < 2^53
As reported by Jeff Hain: pow(double,double): Math.pow(-1.0,5.000000000000001E15) = -1.0 FastMath.pow(-1.0,5.000000000000001E15) = 1.0 ===> This is due to considering that power is an even integer if it is >= 2^52, while you need to test that it is >= 2^53 for it. ===> replace "if (y >= TWO_POWER_52 || y <= -TWO_POWER_52)" with "if (y >= 2*TWO_POWER_52 || y <= -2*TWO_POWER_52)" and that solves it.
