getLInfNorm() uses wrong formula in both ArrayRealVector and OpenMapRealVector (in different ways)
the L_infinity norm of a finite dimensional vector is just the max of the absolute value of its entries. The current implementation in ArrayRealVector has a typo: {code} public double getLInfNorm() { double max = 0; for (double a : data) { max += Math.max(max, Math.abs(a)); } return max; } {code} the += should just be an =. There is sadly a unit test assuring us that this is the correct behavior (effectively a regression-only test, not a test for correctness). Worse, the implementation in OpenMapRealVector is not even positive semi-definite: {code} public double getLInfNorm() { double max = 0; Iterator iter = entries.iterator(); while (iter.hasNext()) { iter.advance(); max += iter.value(); } return max; } {code} I would suggest that this method be moved up to the AbstractRealVector superclass and implemented using the sparseIterator(): {code} public double getLInfNorm() { double norm = 0; Iterator<Entry> it = sparseIterator(); Entry e; while(it.hasNext() && (e = it.next()) != null) { norm = Math.max(norm, Math.abs(e.getValue())); } return norm; } {code} Unit tests with negative valued vectors would be helpful to check for this kind of thing in the future.
